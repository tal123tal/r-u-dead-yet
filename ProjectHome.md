R-U-Dead-Yet, or RUDY for short, implements the generic HTTP DoS attack via long form field submissions. More technical details about layer-7 DDoS attacks can be found in this OWASP lecture:

http://www.hybridsec.com/papers/OWASP-Universal-HTTP-DoS.ppt

This tool runs with an interactive console menu, automatically detecting forms within given URL, and allowing the user to choose which forms and form fields are desirable to use for the POST attack. In addition, the tool offers unattended execution by providing the necessary parameters within a configuration file.
In version 2.x RUDY supports SOCKS proxies and session persistence using cookies when available.

RUDY was named after the Children of Bodom album - ["Are You Dead Yet?"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_Dead_Yet)
